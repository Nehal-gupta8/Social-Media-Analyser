# Social Network Analysis in C++

A C++ implementation of social network analysis algorithms including influencer detection, friend recommendation, and community detection.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: Efficient storage of social connections using adjacency lists
- **Influencer Detection**: PageRank algorithm implementation to identify key users
- **Friend Recommendation**: Jaccard similarity-based suggestions
- **Community Detection**: Modularity optimization for finding network communities

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **PageRank** (with damping factor and convergence detection)
2. **Jaccard Similarity** for friend recommendations
3. **Louvain-inspired Community Detection** using modularity gain
